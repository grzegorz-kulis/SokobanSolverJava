Improve state generating code:
    1. Solution appending, that can be done better, neater                                                  Not really
    2. checking solution, should be fed with only sets                                                      DONE
    3. Singleton? We just need one copy of this.                                                            Not really
    4. Multi-threading for the better performance (time)                                                    TODO
    5. While checking moves, code should be as much generic as possible, there are repetitions right now    DONE
    6. Check solution after generating state, that saves iterations/time                                    DONE

Measure number of iterations until solution was found                                                       DONE
Measure time until solution was found                                                                       DONE
Deep Copy should be JUST interface!                                                                         DONE
Implement DeepCopy only where it is really needed!                                                          DONE
Create own interface which would overwrite compareTo so that states can be easily compared                  Not really
Do something about state.hashState, ugly af                                                                 TODO
Add simple deadlock checking                                                                                TODO
Add feature that would auto-generate deadlock states based on given map/state                               TODO
Add improved deadlock checking                                                                              TODO
Add a function which would determine how the new states would be generated                                  TODO
Add a feature which would let user to choose between search algorithms (BFS, DFS etc.)                      TODO
Multi-threading! Number of threads = number of boxes (just for now)                                         TODO
Enums instead of chars in classes                                                                           DONE
